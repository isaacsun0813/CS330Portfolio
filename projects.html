                <p>
                    Essentially, my team and I created a web application that keeps track
                    of the occupancy in practice rooms across campus. As a Bienen student, the wost
                    feeling is biking down all the way from north campus only to be met with full practice rooms.
                    BetterPracttice solves this problem.

                    Here's a map of RCMA floor 3 (Bienen's main practice rooms). As you can see, the green
                    markers represent available practice rooms and red ones indicate occupied. These were kept track of
                    with a sign in and sign out system that students used on their mobile devices.

                <p>
                    The front end is a combination of html pages and react components to
                      display a real map, markers on that map, and all of our display pages. The back end utilizes django to create and
                       run a database of users, rooms, and room checkins/checkouts. My team used the RESTful API to have our front end and back end communicate.

                <p>
                    For my final project in CS211 I recreated the retro game Minesweeper in C++ with the gaming library GE211. It implements the
                    MVC platter for game design.

                <p>
                   The entire tech stack is based in C++. Essentially the MVC design pattern symbolizes model, view, and controller.
                   In essence, we had to design a model that handled game logic, a view that acted as the user interface,
                   and a controller that affected data flow from the model object and into the view UI.
